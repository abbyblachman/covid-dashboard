### COVID-19 State Tracker

This application queries data live from the <strong>Covid Tracking Project</strong> API: https://covidtracking.com/api/. 

View the deployed application here: https://covid-state-tracker.herokuapp.com/.

It is built using React JS, Node JS, and Chart JS. 

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. Once you clone, change into the root directory, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
